TESTING RFEMI:
Follow general instrucions in  test.
All files needed for processing the test data set are included.
Note that sensors files needed for system callibration are in
subdirectory /sensors

* First you need to make and install rfemi (exactly as for making rfasc)
  as well as dnff, tranmt

* Then test rfemi.  THere is an MT-1 data file called d05l1_ts1.mt1
  in EMI-MT1/DATA .  Change into this directory , and type
                 ../../bin/rfemi
  Here are prompts from the program (>>>) and appropriate answers 
  for the test case:
	>>> station id
	D05
	>>> enter output file name
	d05l1_ts1.bin
	>>> input file name
	d05l1_ts1.mt1
	>>> enter clock reset file name
	d05l1_ts1.clk
	>>> another input file? (append to current output file)
	n
	>>> continue?
	n

 After this run completes you will find two new files in DATA:
 d05l1_ts1.bin (reformatted binary data file), and d05l1_ts1.sp
 (system paramter file taken from header of EMI-MT1 data file)

* Go up, one directory to EMI-MT1.  Run 
            ../bin/dnff
  Note that paths.cfg is set up to look for the *.sp file in the DATA
  directory (along with the data file)

  Here are prompts from the program (>>>) and appropriate answers
  for the test case:

	>>> Enter input file name:  d05l1_ts1.bin
	>>> FT another data file?  n

  After this completes you will find a Fourier coefficent file in 
  subdirectory FC called   d05l1_ts1.f5

* Run   ../bin/tranmt

  Here are prompts from the program (>>>) and appropriate answers
  for the test case:

	>>> enter control file name
	tranmt.cfg

  There will now be a file in subdirectory MT called: d05l1_1.zss

* Plot in matlab; set up matlab search path (as described in test/README) 
  and type apresplt in matlab.  Use the dialogue box that opens to pick
  the Z-file d05l1_1.zss.  A plot of apparent resistivity and phase
  should appear.

*  Compare resulst to the corresponding Z-file in Results.
  Note that there are two other files in this directory.  
  You can further test the code, and get more experience with some of
  the options by replicating these other runs also.

   d05l1_NR.zss  was run with robust features turned off
   (to replicate this: (1) set robust to 'n' in options.cfg,
   and (2) change the name of the output file in tranmt.cfg,
   and (3) re-run tranmt).
    
   d05l1_COH.zss  was run using the coherence sorting paramters set
   to non-zero values as in optionsCOH.cfg.  To replicate this,
   change the name of the options file, and the output file name in
   tranmt.cfg and re-run.

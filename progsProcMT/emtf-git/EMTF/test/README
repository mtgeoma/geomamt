THIS DIRECTORY CONTAINS SOME ARTIFICIAL TEST DATA  AND EXAMPLES OF CONTROL FILES
USE THESE FOR testing FFT and Transfer function programs in EMTF

The subdirectories are:
CF/      configuration file directory
DATA/    directory with artificial data in ASCII files
FC/      empty directory where Fourier coefficient files will be written
SP/      directory for system parameter files
MT/      directory where standard robust MT processing results are written
MMT/     directory where robust multiple station MT processing results 
			are written
results/ directory containing final results you should get (for comparison)
bin/     temporary bin directory for testing code
sensors/ empty sensors directory (not used in testing)
options.cfg, options_RR.cfg, tranmt.cfg    configuration files for tranmt
paths.cfg      path name file for dnff


TO TEST:

1) MAKE AND INSTALL FORTRAN EXECUTABLES 

Simplest (if Makefiles need no changes for your system ...):
just type INSTALL   from this directory.  This will do the following

   ==> in RF/RFASC   :  make rfasc ; make install ; make clean
   --  dnff in D     :  make dnff ; make install ; make clean
   --  trantmt in T  :  make tranmt ; make install ; make clean

Uncomment lines for multmtrn, bin2asc, and/or rfemi if you want any
of these programs also.

after installation executables will be in test/bin move these to
your bin directory.
  

2) RUN TESTS ON FORTRAN PROGRAMS
   a) rfasc  :  from directory test/DATA run : ../bin/rfasc

	For the following prompts (>>>) give these responses

	>>> station id
	TS1
 	>>> enter output file name
	test1.bin
 	>>> enter header (80 character max)
	testing 1, 2, 3, ...
 	>>> input file name
	test1.asc
 	>>> enter clock reset file name
	test1.clk
 	>>> another input file? (append to current output file)
	n
	>>> continue?
	n  (or answer 'y' and then go ahead and translate test2.asc)

       

 	  -->  A binary data file test1.bin will appear in DATA

   b.1) dnff  :  from the main test directory (test/) run : bin/dnff

	For the following prompts (>>>) give these responses

	>>> Enter input file name: 
	test1.bin
	>>> FT another data file? 
	n  (or answer 'y' and go ahead and FFT test2.bin)

	   -->  A binary Foirier coefficient file test1.f5 will appear in FC

   b.2) To test dnff on ASCII files run : bin/dnff -a

	>>> Enter input file name: 
	test1.asc
	>>> FT another data file? 
	n

	   -->  A binary Fourier coefficient file test1.f5 will appear in FC

      Note that the FC files resulting from applying (a) to test1.asc
	followed by (b.1) to the output, should be identical to applying
	(b.2) directly to test.asc

    Repeat (b.2) on the second test ASCII file before doing step (c):

	>>> Enter input file name: 
	test2.asc
	>>> FT another data file? 
	n

    c) tranmt : from test run : bin/tranmt

	For the following prompts (>>>) give these responses

	>>> enter control file name
	tranmt.cfg

	   -->  Three ASCII Transfer Function output files  (Z-files)
		will appear in MT .  These are called 
		test1.zss	 --> single station results from test1.asc
		test2.zss	 --> single station results from test2.asc
		test2r1.zrr	 --> Remote ref results from test1.asc
					(test2.asc is remote)

		These three output files should agreee with the
		files of the same names in test/results

		NOTE: There if you run dnff with the -x option
 		test1.sdm test2.sdm and test2r1.sdm will also
		be generated.  These cross-product files can be
		easily imported into GEOTOOLS.  Files to compare
		cross-product files to are also in test/results

    c) multmtrn : from test/MMT run : ../bin/multmtrn

		By default the program uses array.cfg (set up
		to use the synthetic test data in test1.f5 and test2.f5)
		The following results files should appear in
		MMT: TEST_1-2.M  , TEST_1-2.Pw  , TEST_1-2.S0,
		TEST 1-2.SN , TS1_TEST_1-2.zmm TS2_TEST_1-2.zmm
		Use sdm_plot.m , Pw_plot.m and apresplt.m to
		plot result files in matlab.  Look at the *.M file
		for an ASCII table output of eigenvalues/eigenvectors
		and various other bits of information.  Compare
		to files of the same names in ../results .

3) MATLAB PLOTTING

	Matlab M-files are in EMTF/matlab .  Within this directory are
	subdirectories IN , UTIL , ZPLT which contain routines used for
	reading and plotting Z-files in matlab.  Put these directories
	in the matlab search path by changning the environment variable
	MATLABPATH, or by using the "path" command in matlab.
	To plot results in the test output files type the command
	"apresplt".  A dialogue box for browsing for *.z* files will
	appear.  Choose the test output files, and plots should appear.
	see additional documentation in doc/PS/matlab_doc.ps,
	and  doc/PS/Z_files.tex for more details.

	For plotting some of the multiple station test output files
	in matlab cd to MMT and run apresplt, Pw_plot, and sdm_plot.

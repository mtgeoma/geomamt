"sys_tf_tbl"  is a program which reads in a standard system parameter file
(called sp<data_file_root>) and outputs a table of complex system parameter corrections
for each channel, as a function of frequency.  The table is ASCII, output with a format of
(11e10.4/10x,10e12.4).  The first entry is frequncy, in hz.  Subsequent pairs are real and imagniary
parts of the filter corrections for each channel.  When the total number of channels exceeds 5,
the second line in the format is used.  These corrections are to be
applied in the frequency domain by multiplying the Fourier coefficients (as computed
by the FFT) by the appropriate complex correction factors in this table.
These frequency dependent complex scaling factors convert magnetic fields 
into units of nT and electric fields into units of mV/km, eliminating filter 
and system response effects.  More precisely, after correction the FCs will
have units of nT/(hz**.5) or mV/(km*(hz**.5)) for magnetic and electric components 
respectively, provided a properly normalized data taper is applied before FFTing.
(As an example, the data taper generated by subroutine "ps1win" (in TR/D/ft_subs.f)
is properly normalized).  Note that the actual sample rate is already 
incorporated into the system correction table output by sys_tbl_su.
Note also that the spacing in log frequency of table entries, the total
length of the table, and the maximun number of channels allowed can be changed in
the include file "fcor.h".

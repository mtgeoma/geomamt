This directory contains source code to make
a simple reformatting program to convert an ASCII
file to the standard data file format required
by the Fourier transform program, dnff.

The file input.bin.f contains source code for reading the
input file.  Change this file to change input file format

There are three subroutines in this file:
  ininit - opens data file, gets clock info (could read from header, do
            other fancy things ... see rfemi)
  frstdat - positions file at start of data (skips any header records)
  indo - reads enough data to make one more output block

Make sure that any replacement routines have the same functions,
and the same arguments, and the rest of the program should be OK.

Note that the output routines are in ../out.bin.f 

Two examples of input.###.f files are provided.
These two files give examples of how to allow for different input
formats by changing input.###.f to suit your own needs.

==> rfasc is made by linking with input.asc.f

This version of input reads an ASCII file
with format = cformat (specified in the header file format.h).
This version assumes that the input ASCII data
file has one sample (all channels in integers) per line, no record number,
all data points contiguous (no gaps, no time markers),
no data file header.

A separate "clock reset file"  is required.  The clock
file has three lines: (1) sampling rate in seconds (NOT hz !!!!),
(2) the time of the first record in the file (yr,mo,day,hr,min, all integers)
(3) the time of record number zero (yr,mo,day,hr,min, all integers)
(this will be the same for all simultaneous stations, and serves
to align data from separate files)
With this reformatting program you have to make system parameter files
yourself.

NOTE:  THE EXACT NUMBER OF CHANNELS, AND THE INPUT FILE FORMAT
NEED TO BE SET IN THE HEADER FILES nch.h AND format.h BEFORE COMPILATION
The header files should come set up to test reformatting the 5 channel
ascii file test/D/a_test

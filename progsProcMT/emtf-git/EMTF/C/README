This directory has code for program clean.
The purposes of this program are two:
to clean up isolated spikes (this may not be necessary in most
cases ...), and to put data into a standard format for other of
my programs, in particular the FFT program.  As discussed elsewhere
this step can be dispensed with by making some simple modifications
to the input subroutines for the FFT program.  However, the easiest way to
use these programs is to just run everything through clean, so that
all data files are in a standard form.  Doing this some other advantages:
the output data files are much smaller than ASCII files, sample numbers
(relative to some specified clock zero) are attached to all data points
so separate data segments (separated by a gap)
from a single station can be concatenated into a single file (provided
system parameters such as gains, filter settings, etc. are not changed
between segments).

In addition to the data file the program needs a file which tells
(1) the digitization rate (in SECONDS, not HZ!!!! - i.e. DELTA T)
(2) the clock time for the first sample in the data file
(3) the reference, or zero time. All data samples are numbered from
    this reference time, so that data from simultaneous stations
     can be alligned

There are several internal parameters which might need to be changed:
- the input data format
- number of channels (e.g., for GDS data)
hopefully, this will be reasonably self explanatory if you
look at the source code.

ALSO: See directory RF to just reformat data files.

This processing step will probably not survive in future,
more organized releases of these processing programs.

This directory contains the robust single station and remote
reference TF program.

To run the standard robust TF program three files control files are needed.
The first (something like bs_test.cfg) controls the bands for which
estimates are produced.  The other two control the data,
which we refer to here as tranmt.cfg and options.cfg, control the data
processing task.  You are prompted for the name of the first of these (tranmt.cfg 
in our example), which basically lists processing runs to do.
The second file, tells the program about various options
(robust or not, remote reference or single station, etc.)
The name of this file (called options.cfg in our example here)
is specified in the tranmt.cfg file.  A separate options.cfg file 
could be used for each run specified in the tranmt.cfg file,
but the general idea is that lots of data sets
will typicaly be processed with the same options.
In practice I would typically set up a file called options.cfg
(for single station processing) and another called cf_opteion.RR
or some such thing for remote reference processing.

This is an anotated version the tranmt.cfg file:

test          <-----    station name; output files will be called mttest, p_test
options.cfg    <-----    the options file for this run
1         <-----    number of stations (1 for single station, 2 for remote ref.)
1 5      <---- for station 1 : number of FC files, number of channels
test.f5   <---- name of first FC file  [ this line could be repeated if the
                  number of FC files is greater than 1 ]
n        <---- NO, do not continue with another set; if the entry is 'y',
               all of the above lines should be repeated with appropriate
                file names etc.



Here is the options.cfg file:

Robust Single station   <--- this is a header which is added to output files
FC                  <--- Input (FC) directory
                        <--- Output directory; put impedance etc. files here
CF/bs_test.cfg           <---- full path name of band set up file
y                <--- 'y' for robust, 'n' for LS
n                <--- 'y' for remote reference, 'n' for single station
n                <--- 'y' for e field ref, 'n' for mag ***** see below*****
n        <----   output coherence vs set no. (if yes provide file name on next line) **** see below****
0. 0. 0. 0. 0    coherence sorting parameters  **** see below*****
1        <---    # of rotations to ouput results for
0.       <---   rotation angle, degrees E of geomag N (one line for each rotation)


########   COHERENCE SORTING PARAMETERS  #########################
4 real numbers and one integer are required in general;  These
are (in order):
       coh_target, cohp(1), cohp(2), coh_min, nu_min

These parameters are used to specify coherence cut off levels for
coherence pre-sorting.  In this scheme coherence is calculated
for wide frequency bands for each time segment, and only time
segments which acheive a specified minimum coherence are used
for further processing.  This feature is most useful for single 
station dead-band data where noise in
the magnetic components can be large enough to cause serious
bias problems with single station estimates.
See Egbert and Liveleybrooks, Geophysics, 1996 for further
discussion and justification.
The five parameters specify a scheme for determining coherence
cut off levels, which adapts to the number of data points and
typical coherence levels.  The scheme tries to trade off
(in an ad hoc manner) between reducing bias and variance -
i.e., we want to use only segments of "high enough" coherence,
but at the same time keep a reasonable number of degrees of 
freedom in the estimates.

Here is the meaning of the 5 numbers:

coh_target - is the target coherence; ideally we would like
  all time segments to achieve this coherence.  (e.g., coht = .95)

cohp - two real parameters used to determine a target number of degrees
   of freedom in the transfre function estimate via : 
         nu_target = cohp(1)*nu**cohp(2) where nu is the number
          of points available (e.g.: cohp(1) = 3., cohp(2) = .5)

coh_min - minimum acceptable coherence level. (e.g., .8)

nu_min  - minimum number of data points (e.g., 20)

If possible we would like to use at least nu_target data points,
all from time segments with coherence at least coh_target.
If there are not nu_target points in sets with
coherence above the target coherence, we accept lower coherence
sets, until nu_target points are available, or until
coh_min (the minimum acceptable coherence) is reached.  In general
we don't accept sets with lower coherence unless this is necessary
to get the minimum number of data points, nu_min.

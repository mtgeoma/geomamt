Chnages to tranmt

Egbert, 2-26-98

* eliminate unused source files from directory, makefile 
  These were used for changing coordinates, computing rho and phi, tipper, etc.
   and outputing ascii tables of results.

*  changed name of wsdm to wrt_z  ... consistent with multmtrn, and function of 
   routine

*  eliminate logical variables lemap and lmt from tranmt.f and setup.f

*  eliminate weighting by power:  bset no longer reads wtparam from band setup (bs_***)
   file; wtparam eliminated from argument list for bset and rxspclev.  Call to wtbpwr
   elminated from rxspclev

*  change name of include file from iosize.h to iosize.inc
   

03/13/98    ME   some inconsistencies discovered with WATCOM/AIX-FC

	tranmt:  declare logical l_PRISET, l_SETS
		declare integer dec_fac
	mkrec:	declare 	logical l_PRISET
	sdmwrite:	subroutine dec2dms
		sig(1,degs) --> sig(1.,degs)
		dms(3) = int(mod(degs,60)) --> 
			dms(3) = int(mod(degs,60.))

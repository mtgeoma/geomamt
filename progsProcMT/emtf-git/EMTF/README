EMTF.tar.gz is a compressed unix tarfile containing source code
documenataion and data for compiling and testing the OSU robust
single station, remote reference and multiple station processing
programs.  The tar file is compressed with "gzip".
After you unpack ("gunzip EMTF.tar.gz"  and "tar xvf EMTF.tar")
you will get a directory called EMTF with the following sub-directories :

doc  :  program documentatation :  

  doc/TEX  contains latex source code 

	EMTF_doc.tex = main documentation for EMTF
	MMT_doc.tex = documentation for MMT (multiple station program)
	matlab_doc.tex = documentation for some matlab plotting programs
	Z_files.tex = documentation for TF output files including
		format and details on rotation/error bar calculation

#######################################################################
# ==> PRINT OUT EMTF_doc FIRST ... BUT JUST READ THE FIRST FEW PAGES  #
#######################################################################

  doc/PS  contains postscript files produced by from the latex files in TEX


test :	Test data sets : use to test other programs
	The main test directory contains instructions in README
	for initial installation and testing of EMTF and MMT programs.
	There is also a sub-directory test/EMI-MT1 which contains
	an example EMI MT-1 data file with instructions for installing
	and testing data reformatting programs for these files.

#		(COMPLINING AND TESTING CODE SHOULD BE EASY           #

RF :	Programs for reformatting data files, including ASCII (rfasc),
	and EMI MT-1 format (rfemi), and a program for translating the
	output standard binary files into an ASCII file (bin2asc).

D :	Program for windowing, decimation, and Fourier Transformation of time
	series files (dnff)

T :	Programs for standard robust single station and RR TF estimation (tranmt)
  
include:	Include files for Fortran programs that are used by programs
	in more than one subdirectory.  These are kept here to reduce chances
	of compiling programs which read and write the same files
	with different parameter values.

C :	Old time series cleaning (despiking) program, which also reformats 
	data into the same format output by programs in RF.

MMT :	Multiple station program (multmtrn); Contains a tar file with source
	code for making libraries consisting of the subset of lapack routines
	and blas routines called by multmrn

matlab:	Some matlab scripts and functions for plotting and post-processing
	output files.

Clark - 

I have placed the newest version of multmtrn on spoon (egbtf/MMTnew).
I have tested on spoon using data in GOM/mah-ns.  All files needed for
the test runs, along with some result files are in GOM/mah-ns/MMT.
I think everything works, but I have not had time to look over the
output files (I can't look at the binary ones ...)

The changes are documented in the README file. Briefly, there are now four
default output file types.  These are:

1) SN_**** files :  as before

2) S0**** files : now contain full SDM + incoherent noise variances.
       matlab input: IN/uev_in.m  IN/sdm_in.m

3) Pw*** files : contain the program's best guess at the "plane wave" response
       vectors, with error info.  See matlab/README.new and matlab/MISC/Pw.m
       for info on how to read/use these files.  As we discussed, you should
       be able to compute any interstation/intercomponent TFs with error bars 
       using the contents of this file.

4) Z***  files : as before (and as for tranmt) these files give TFs for the
       last nch-2 channels relative to the first 2 channels for a series of
       station groups.  By default the grouping of channels into stations is
       determined by the grouping of channels in the FC files (this used to
       be the only option).  Now by running the program with the command line
       option -s<control file name> the default groupings can be changed.
       For details/examples see the README file in MMTnew, and the cf_grp 
       files in GOM/mah-ns/MMT.  Note that the maximum number of groupings
       (ngrpmx) and the maximum number of channels in a station group 
       (nchemx) to allow for is set in nstamx.h (separately from maximum 
       number of stations and channels, (nstam and nchmx)).

I have also added new/modifed versions of matlab scripts to the matlab directory
on spoon, but these have obviously not been tested there.  Let me know
if I forgot to include anything.  I am also in the process of developing a
graphical tool for plotting/manipulating the contents of the sdm file (S0***).
I'll let you know when I have something useable.

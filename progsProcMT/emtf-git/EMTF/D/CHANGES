Changes to DNFF

- moved include file  ../datsz.h  datsz.inc (into source dir)
- include files:
	datsz.inc		old datsz.h
       	input.inc		all input related vars
       	params1.inc		all general parameters
	params2.inc 		3 general parameters also incl. 
				in decimate.inc
	decimate.inc		all decimation related stuff
	iounits.inc		files, I/O units

	../include/four_byte.h

-	the BIN_DIR in the Makefile has to be edited to use
	'make install' properly. In the Makefile all dependencies
	are listed.


-  	integer*2 and integer*4 binary input files supported.
	Either set parameter NBYTES in PARMAS1.INC or use command
	line option -b2 or -b4.
-	System response tables: added to new identifiers for reading
	the system responses from a simple table format. 
	AP: identifier for a table which has amplitudes and phases
	RI: identifier for table of real and imaginary parts.
	Both are asumed to be functions of FREQUENCY. All preceding 
	lines which start with a non-numeric character ( 0 - 9 ) 
	on the first non-white-space field are asumed to be 
	header/comment lines.
	From the first line which has a numeric character a three
	column table is read until EOF or ERROR. RESPTBL tests for
	increasing sequence of frequnecies and reorders if not true.
	Associated iftypes:  	AP: iftype = 98
				RI: iftype = 99
-	system response tables are asumed to be in a directory
	sensors (subdirectory of the working directory). But if
	the file is not found the user is prompted for a different
	file name.
-	changed the default name for the paths file to 'paths.cfg'.
	In case this file doesn't exist, prompt the user for a 
	different file name or hit return for no paths file.
- 	changed the default name for the SP file from sp... to
	croot(1:mi-3)//'.sp', assuming that the input file is in the
	form '<siteid>.dat'. 


-  More minor changes by Egbert, 2-19-98

change variable time_interval ==> time_int  
    (time_interval is a function in qlib, needed for seed version)

-    Egbert 2-20-98

changes to resptbl.f :
   format for reading emi sensors files :   *  ==>   g6.0
   add code for trying to avoid problems with upper/lower case
   in sensors files names

-  Egbert 2/23-24

* changes to fcorsu.f to fix minor problem with correction of
digital anti-alias filters used prior to decimation

* found bug in low pass filter decimation filter routine
dcfilt.f: array fc was declared fc(nd,*) in this routine,
but fc(ndmax,*) in decset.

*  add nfilmax to declarations in params2.inc (remove from params1.inc)
and include params2.inc in getsp (to get rid of separate definitions
of parameter nfilmax in several files).

*  eliiminate rdfc from decset.f  (last step in fixing bug with fc() array

*  changes to eliminate decimation levels with nfuse(id) = 0 in
decset.cfg file.  This allows you to decimate and keep FCs from
only higher decimatin levels (longer periods).
There are three changes:  (1)  after decimation
add line of code at begining of loop over decimation levels.  

      do 200 id = 1,nd
      if(nfuse(id) .gt. 0) then
             .
             .
             .
      endif 
200   continue

	i.e., Don't FT or save sets from decimation levels with nfuse(id) = 0 . 

	(2) Before writing header for output FC file,	
	 eliminate decimation levels 
	with nfuse(id) = 0 ; add this code after 490  continue :

	iid = 0
	do id = 1,nd
         if(nfuse(id) .gt. 0) then
            iid = iid + 1
            idl(iid) = idl(id)
            nwin(iid) = nwin(id)
         endif
        enddo

	(3)   change argument 2 to wfhead from nd to iid 
		(new number of "good" decimation levels).

*  Eliminate parameter fsv ... the size of FC arrays is just calculated now

*  Made lpack a parameter and added declaration to params1.inc

*  Changed way that the program strips off a suffix from a data file
to make a .sp , .rec or .f5 file . Now we search from the begining of
the string for the first occurence of a blank or period, and use
what preceeds this as the file root.  (New function irlong, patterned 
after iclong).   So now the .sp file for a file named either
data_file or data_file.bin would just be data_file.sp   

*  Editing out commented out lines as I go

*  Add capability to read simple ascii files.  Changes include:
  -->  additional command line options -a ( ascii file with separate
     .clk file with clock reset info) and -A (ASCII file with
      clock reset info in first 3 lines of file)
  --> new logical variables to keep track of ascii options declared in
      input.inc
  --> additional code in cininit (in inpou_bin.f) to
      initialize reading  from ascii files
  --> two new subroutines in asc_rec.f: (1) asc_rec, which reads
       clock info (from *.clk file made from input file name,(-a) or
      from header(-A)), and initializes time_int, irec, nch;
      (2) rdasc , which is used in place of rdblk with both -a and -A
      options.

*  corrected apparent bug:  offset to add to sample numbers  in
data file was called ioff and was set to zero in main.
This should be set in bdrcsu but instead ioffc was set (and never
used for anything).

*  still need to think about:  setting of   time_int
In previous version this was set to clock0/dr ; but proper
relation of time_int to clock0 depends on how clock0 is
set by programs which write binary data files.  Old versions by
egbert already added clock0 to sample numbers in data file,
so time_int should always be zero.  But maybe this should change????
For now time_int is set to zero in dnff ...

Eisel  2/26/98

added a check for overflow of nsmax (max # of sets). Program exits main
loop and prints out warning. 
Makefile updated for params2.inc (included in decimate.inc)

2/27/98
INCLUDE FILES: ../include/datsz.inc includes nchmx.inc. For compiling
on the IBMs 
       include 'nchmx.inc'
needs to be changed to
       include '../include/nchmx.inc'

In turn, params2.inc has to be changed, because her nchmx is set again.

        parameter       (nchmx = 10)
 ==>
	include '../include/nchmx.inc'


March 20, 1998   G. Egbert

1) changed channel IDs (array chid) from character*2
to character*6

This involves changes in D to:
		out_pack.f
		getsp.f
		dnff.f
and in T to:
		rfhead.f
		tranmt.f
		wrt_z.f
		setup.f
		sdmwrite.f
and in MMT to :
		readfvg.f
		setup.f
		wrt_z.f
		multmtrn.f
		extra.f

2) changed   decset.f to eliminate complications with pwset.cfg
   	in partitucal no more -- reading # of channels in first line
		-- reading different prewhitening options for each
			channel
		NOw the same pwset.cfg file can be used for any number
		of data channels

March 21, 1998   G. Egbert

1)   added a new filter type : 'UC' == uncallibrated coil 
		response assumed to be i omega (better than  nothing
		for long period response of coils?)

		This filter is assigned iftype = 97 in getsp, 
		response is specified in fcorsu

2)   BUG FIX:   cfn is only character*2 ... does not allow to write
     f10 or more into this character string for making output FC file
     name for 10 or more channel data files  (why did this work
	before????)

March 23, 1998  G. Egbert

Fix bug in ptdist.m

Changed if/then block from:

        if(i2 .gt. i1) then
           lstart = .true.
           nacc = i2-i1
        else
           nacc = nmax - i1 + i2
        end if

To:

        if(i2 .eq. i1) then
           nacc = 0
        elseif(i2 .gt. i1) then
           lstart = .true.
           nacc = i2-i1
        else
           nacc = nmax - i1 + i2
        end if


i.e., added special canse for i2.eq.i1

RHOPLUS: Optimum Fits and Bounds for MT data, $rho sub a$ and $phi$
.R
John. R. Booker and Robert L. Parker
.sp 0.5
.PP
This program solves exactly the one-dimensional (1D) inverse
problem of magnetotellurics given a set of apparent resistivity
and phase data.  The theory is the same as $D sup +$
except that calculations are done in the complex $omega$
plane on the log of $c$, not $c$ itself (Parker and Booker, 1996).
Input data can be mixtures
of apparent resistivity ($rho sub a$) and
impedance phase ($phi$) at the same or different
frequencies; $rho sub a$ alone, or $phi$ plus
just one $rho sub a$.  The following
calculations can be done: (1) compute the best fit to the data
in the weighted 2-norm sense; (2) calculate the model in
the space of positive delta functions (D+) that achieves
this minimum misfit; (3) find the upper and lower
bound on either $rho sub a$ or $phi$ holding $chi sup 2$
fixed at some tolerance corresponding to a misfit above the
minimum possible; (4) Optimally repair tears in apparent
resistivity resulting from different instrumental or site gains
in non-overlapping frequency bands.
.PP
The program operates under a simple command line-interpreter
in which you can enter commands interactively.
If you prefer
to run the program from a file, you can re-direct a file
containing the command script to standard input or you can
you can use the interactive command that will switch from
keyboard input to reading commands from a named file.
The following is a typical command script.
A percent sign tells the
program to ignore any text following so that you
can disable any command by putting a % in the first position
or you can document input scripts like this one:

\fBCommand Catalog\fR
.PP
Every command takes the following form: a command word,
which may always be abbreviated to its first four letters
and which may appear alone or be followed by one or more
spaces, then numbers or text.  The command word must start at
the beginning of the line; lines starting with a blank are
treated as comments and are ignored. Unrecognized commands
are also ignored. This may lead to unexpected
results if commands are read from a file and are skipped
because of typos. It has been
done this way to give an interactive user the opportunity to
re-enter a miss-typed command. If commands are repeated with
different options, the last
entry is the one that is obeyed. In the following, default values are
those the program assigns if you do not explicitly set them;
you may rely on these defaults as sensible choices in most
cases. All information enclosed in [ ] is user supplied;
information enclosed in { } is optional.
.sp 0.5
.LP
\fIGeneral\fR:
.XP
\fB?\fR: Print a glossary of commands to standard error
(usually the screen, unit 0, but can be made any unit
by changing the the constant \fIierr\fR in \fIblockdata iounit\fR).
There are several help screens. After each topic is printed you
are asked for input: a carriage return skips to the
next topic; a y prints the next topic; 
r{esume} returns control to the command interpreter. The
command \fIhelp\fR is a synonym for \fI?\fR.
.XP
\fBexecute\fR: With the required commands and
options saved in memory, begin
the calculations for this run.  The program always finds the
best-fitting solution (the smallest $chi sup 2$) compatible
with the input data and reports the minimum misfit. If you
use the \fIbands\fR command, you can calculate optimum
gains in different data bands relative to the first band defined.
The \fImodel\fR command will additionally
calculate the corresponding best-fitting model in D+.
Finally, if requested in the \fItask\fR file, the program will also
find limits on acceptable data values at arbitrary frequencies.
An end-of-file is interpreted as an \fIexecute\fR command in
the case that the data and task are read from named files rather
than following the command script as in the the example above.
The command \fIcontinue\fR is a synonym for \fIexecute\fR.
.XP
\fBq{uit}\fR: Exit program. Can only
be invoked prior to the \fIexecute\fR command. This
command can be abbreviated to less than four letters.
.XP
\fBecho {choice}\fR: Turns echoing of commands
as they are executed {on} or {off}. However, you can enter
commands in any order, with the exceptions
that \fIexecute\fR must be last and \fIread\fR permanently transfers
reading of commands to a named file. The default
is \fIecho off\fR. The default if {choice} is blank
is \fIecho on\fR. If the general output goes to your screen,
there will sometimes be two echos.
.sp 0.5
.LP
\fIInput\fR:
.XP
\fBread [filename]\fR: Immediately transfers reading of commands
and options to the named file. The program terminates if it cannot
open the named file for reading. You can chain \fIread\fR commands,
but once invoked, you cannot return to the point you were at
when a read command was issued. This means that a read command that
points back to a file already read will generate an infinite loop.
.XP
\fBdatafile\fR [filename]: It is \fImandatory\fR to give the
program data and their errors at frequencies on which
the computations are to be performed. No $phi$ data are required,
but $rho sub a$ at at least one frequency is required.
The data can be provided in a text file called [filename].
Alternatively, you may enter an asterisk as in the example;  then
the data are read from the standard input, immediately after
the \fIexecute\fR command has been given. Blank lines before, after
or within the data are ignored. The format of each line of the file
is as follows:
.RS
.TS
tab(	);
c c c c c c c.
f	$rho sub a$	$delta rho sub a$	$phi$	$delta phi$	{ $dnwt ( rho sub a )$	$dnwt ( phi )$ }
.TE
.RE
where: f is the frequency in Hz of the data on the line (or the
period in seconds if the \fIperiod\fR command has been invoked);
$ rho sub a $ is the apparent resistivity in Ohm-m and $delta
rho sub a$ is its estimated uncertainty; $phi$ is the phase
in degrees and $delta phi$ is its estimated uncertainty.
Frequencies (or periods) must monotonically increase or decrease.
Uncertainties are assumed to be one standard deviation.
$phi$ is assumed to be in the first quadrant
(i.e. between 0 and 90 degrees).
.sp 0.5
The two down-weights at the end of the line are optional, but if one
is there, both must be there. The estimated uncertainties of each
datum on the line are \fImultiplied\fR by the appropriate down-weight
prior to further calculations.
The re-weighted errors are shown on any plot
generated. A down-weight of 0.0 is a special case that
means ignore this datum (i.e. is equivalent to an infinite
uncertainty). Negative errors are set to zero by the program and the
corresponding data are ignored in the computations.
Zero errors also cause the program to ignore the corresponding datum.
Finally, the program ignores any $rho sub a~
<=~0$ in all calculations.
.sp 0.5
Reading of data terminates when the program finds a zero frequency
or an end-of-file. Numbers following the initial 0 on a data line
are ignored as long as the 0 is followed by at least one blank.
.sp 0.5
It is worth noting that the algorithm actually fits
$log sub e ( rho sub a )$ and radian $phi$. Thus data are
internally converted to their logarithmic form
$delta log sub e ( rho sub a )~=~ delta rho sub a / rho sub a$ and
errors in $rho sub a$ are thus assumed to be log normally distributed.
The practical implications of the differences between normally
and log normally distributed errors are small unless errors are large.
.XP
\fBperiod\fR: Period in seconds is provided in the first position
of the data and task files instead of frequency.
.XP
\fBlogdata\fR: Invoking this option implies that the resistivity
data are $log sub 10 ( rho sub a )$ and their errors are
$delta log sub 10 ( rho sub a )~=~0.4343~delta rho sub a / rho sub a$.
As already noted, log data and errors are more fundamental to the algorithm.
Negative values of logarithmic data are permitted, but negative
errors still cause the program to skip the corresponding datum.
Using this option also causes parallel changes in some of the output. 
.sp 0.5
.LP
\fIComputation\fR:
.XP
\fBsurface\fR [choice]: Makes the upper surface boundary condition
\fIcon{ducting}\fR
or \fIins{ulating}\fR. The default is \fIcon{ducting}\fR.
If you are warned that the program is trying
to reverse the surface condition, you should change it
and re-run the program. If neither or both choices result
in such a warning, you should use the choice that results in
the smaller $chi sup 2$.
.XP
\fBmodel\fR: Compute the best-fitting model in D+.
.XP
\fBtask\fR [filename]: Optionally, you may provide a file of
frequencies in any order at which the $phi$ or $rho sub a$
values consistent with the data are bounded above and
below. The level of misfit deemed acceptable is provided
through the \fIcriterion\fR command and must exceed the
minimum possible. The format of each line
of the task file is as follows:
.RS
.TS
tab(	);
c c c.
f	[{rho}	{phi}]
.TE
.RE
Again, f is the desired frequency at which the bound is
to be calculated (or the period, if the \fIperiod\fR command was invoked
to read in the original data).
One or both of the words \fIrho\fR or \fIphi\fR tell
the program the kind of bounds desired. The reading of the task
file is again terminated by zero frequency or by an end-of file.
.sp 0.5
Instead of a separate file, the tasks can be tabulated on standard input
at the end of the data, as in
the  example above; the [filename] is then an asterisk.
There can be blank lines between the observation and task tables,
but no other characters. There can also be blank lines within the
task input.
.sp 0.5
Alternatively, the word \fIimplicit\fR can be entered for the
[filename]; then the program looks for frequencies in the input
data at which any of the measurements are missing (have uncertainties
$<=~0.0$ or $rho sub a~<=~0$ or have been
excluded by setting a down-weight to zero)
and finds the bounds on those variables.
.XP
\fBcriterion\fR [#]: In the bounding exercise, a level of
tolerable misfit to the included input data is needed.
[#] is the target value of either $chi sup 2$ or $1-q$, where
$q$ is the probability
that the target misfit will be exceeded by chance. 
The second option is understood if $0~<~[#]~<1$.
By default, the program assumes a target value of $chi sup 2$
corresponding to $1-q$ = [#] = 0.95, the 95% confidence level.
.XP
\fBbands\fR [2N numbers] {-#} {p{runephase}}: This command
allows you to specify the
frequency indices of the bottom and top of up to four
bands. The bands need not be in ascending order or
adjacent, but they must not overlap.
If there are N bands, there will be 2N indices.
Only $rho sub a $ data inside these bands will be used
for computations. Whether $phi$ data are also eliminated outside
the bands depends on the option {-#} and whether the argument
{prunephase} (which can be abbreviated to as short as
its leading letter) is present. The
indices correspond to the data frequencies (periods) in the
order that they are given in the data file. Thus 1 is the first
frequency, etc. The first band you define need not start with
1. For example \fIbands 10 19 2 8 23 29\fR defines three
bands within at least 29 data frequencies.
.sp 0.5
The option number {-#}
(which has a default value of 0) enables
estimation of the average gain (the number you multiply
times the $rho sub a$) in each band
that minimizes the misfit of the best-fitting model.
Using this feature one can, for instance,
determine the optimum merge of data taken at the same site by
a long period and a wideband system. One can also test for
incorrect gain calibrations in different bands of a wideband system.
.sp 0.5
The \fIbands\fR command assumes that the gain in
the first band defined will be held fixed (at 1 unless set otherwise
by the \fIgains\fR command). The program computes the optimum
gain of the next band relative to the first and then
the next with respect to the first two after band two is corrected
and so forth. Thus the first band defined
is the one that is assumed to have the correct gain.
The order in which the bands are incorporated is completely
flexible aside from the requirement that the bands not overlap.
(Note: there is a flag that you can set in \fIsubroutine gtband\fR
that tells the program to use only the $rho sub a$ in the first
band and the band whose gain is currently being estimated rather than
all the previously corrected $rho sub a$. See comments in that
subroutine.)
.sp 0.5
The option {-#} controls the specifics of how the gains are computed:
.RS
.IP $>=0$
All gains are held fixed. This is simply an alternate way to limit
which data are included in any computations and is the default if
the final option number is missing or has an illegal value.
This option automatically excludes all phase data outside of the
defined bands. 
.IP -1
The optimum gain is found by shifting all the $rho sub a$ in the
band until the misfit to all the data currently included is
minimized. For the gain in the second band, this means all
the $rho sub a$ data in the first two bands that have not been
otherwise excluded, plus all the included $phi$ data.
.IP -2
The optimum gain is found by shifting all the $rho sub a$ in the
band until the misfit to the $rho sub a$ data currently
included is minimized. Subsequent tasks are done with all phase
excluded. This is equivalent to option -1 with all phase down-weights
set to 0.
.IP -3
Optimum gains are computed as in option -2, but
in subsequent bounding tasks, phases not otherwise excluded
are included again.
.LP
Additional options -4 and -5 exist, but will probably be of little
interest. Their effect is described
in comments at the beginning of \fIsubroutine gtband\fR.
All options that enable gain estimation require the argument
\fIprunephase\fR if you want to exclude $phi$ outside the
defined bands. If this argument is not present, all phase data
are used unless excluded by 0.0 down-weights or non-positive errors.
.RE
.XP
\fBgains\fR [N numbers]: This command modifies the effect of the
\fIbands\fR command. It requires N numerical arguments, where
N is the number of bands defined by \fIbands\fR. Each number
multiplies $rho sub a$ (or is \fIadded\fR to $log sub 10 ( rho sub a )$
in the case that \fIlogdata\fR is invoked). The order of the gains
is the same as defined by \fIbands\fR. The gains are
applied prior to any further calculations. The gain applied to the
first band is subsequently held fixed. If the gain is \fInot\fR 1.0
(0.0 for \fIlogdata\fR) in any subsequent band, the gain in
that band immediately becomes frozen and will not be estimated.
For example, if $logdata$ is in force and the bands are
defined by \fIbands 10 19 2 8 23 29 -1 prune\fR, the command
\fIgains\fR .301 0. 1. implies that the log resistivities in
band 10-19 will be increased by 0.301 (equivalent to multiplying the
$rho sub a$ by 2.); then the gain in band 2-8 will be estimated
using the modified resistivities in band 10-19 and the phases within
all the bands; band 23-29 will have its
log 10 resistivity increased by 1. (equivalent to multiplying
$rho sub a $ by 10.), but its gain will \fInot\fR be estimated. Because
it was the final band defined, the modified resistivities
in band 23-29 are not used in estimating the gain of
band 2-8, but will be used in any subsequent bounding tasks.
Because \fIprune\fR is present, all calculations
ignore phase data between the bands (i.e. 1, 9 and 20-22).
.XP
\fBnlambda\fR [#]:
The program reports the number of samples on the
imaginary axis of the $omega$ plane following
the data read from the input file.
You can force the program to sample the imaginary
axis at [#] points instead of the number
it chooses with the aid of an internal formula.
You may want more accuracy (larger [#]) or more speed (smaller [#]).
In general, you should use the smallest value of [#] that you can
get away with, because execution time rises rapidly with the number
of samples. The default is a compromise that should result in 2.5
significant figures of accuracy in the responses,
which is comparable to the very
best data.

nothing about the actual bound between points where bounds are calculated.
Whether or not the plot is fancy, original data are shown as filled

Error messages will be generated if obvious things are
incorrect, such as the absence of a data file, or when the
target misfit in the bounding part of the program is less
than the minimum possible. Warnings are printed when things
may not be working as you may have intended. A warning is also
printed when the
iterative solution of the bounding problem fails. At the
end, the failed bounds are noted in the summary table.
.PP
The program runs in less than 1.5 MB as dimensioned.
Execution time is dominated by solution of the Bounded
Value Least Squares (BVLS) problem. Thus finding the
best-fitting model is very fast. Finding optimum gains
or bounding data are much slower because they are iterative
and a BVLS problem  must be solved at each iteration.
The BVLS code responds well to compilation optimization and
thus optimization can reduce execution time dramatically.

Figures 1 to 3 illustrate application of many of the
features of this program to the problem of detecting and
correcting probable data inconsistencies in responses from a
single dipole of
an EMAP collected in south-central Oklahoma. Although the data
are not 1-D, the dipole in question is
assumed to be nearly perpendicular to strike and thus should
be B-Polarization (TM mode). Weidelt and Kaikkonen (1994)
show that 2D responses for this
polarization fall within the space spanned by all 1D responses.
More generally, Rhoplus provides a way of fitting a response
to noisy data that is guaranteed to have a physically acceptable
(causal) relationship between $rho sub a$ and $phi$. Although
E-polarization (TE) and 3D data cannot be guaranteed to have
a $rho sub a~-~phi$ relationship that falls within the set spanned
by 1D responses, the situations in which they do not are
rare enough that it is always worth trying the techniques
that we describe on non-1D data.
.PP
A table of the input used to generate
the results in Figure 3 is appended. The results
in Figures 1 and 2 can be generated by suitable editing.
These data were provided by Exxon courtesy of Leonard Srnka and
are one of the examples in Parker and Booker (1996).
.PP
The program is first run on all the data. The minimum
possible $chi sup 2$ of 91.46 exceeds the 95% confidence
target and so no bounds can be calculated. Note that
the data with periods greater than 0.3 s are well-fit. The
large $chi sup 2$ is clearly coming from the shorter period data
and involves a systematic bias of the fit to $rho sub a$ and
a systematic trend to the misfit to the predicted $phi$.
.PP
Figure 2 fits only the phase data and one of the well-determined
longer-period resistivities. The $chi sup 2$ is now small enough to
estimate bounds. However, the only bound requested was
for the phase at 4.5 Hz (0.22 s). Inspection of Figure 1 suggested
that this phase datum might be an outlier despite the fact
that the predicted phase response fortuitously runs though its
error bar. Figure 2, which was generated with \fIplot xyplot fancy\fR,
clearly allows one to conclude that this datum is an outlier
in the context of the complete phase data set. Not only does its
most probable value lie below the lower bound, but its
range within its error estimate also lies almost entirely below
the bound. The excellent
fit to the rest of the phase and most of the resistivities
plus the obvious systematic bias
of the predicted $rho sub a$ with respect to the eight
high frequency data,
clearly suggests a tear in the resistivity data between 3.0
and 4.5 Hz.
.PP
Both $rho sub a$ and $phi$ at 4.5 Hz were excluded from the
computation shown in Figure 3. Excluding a suspected
outlier leads to more generous bounds if its exclusion
decreases the $chi sup 2$ of the best-fitting model.
Thus, a datum that falls outside these more
generous bounds can be judged inconsistent with more confidence.
.PP
In Figure 3, the optimum gain for the seven highest frequency
$rho sub a$
was estimated using option -1. The result is a gain of
1.344 and a large
reduction in the $chi sup 2$ relative to Figure 1.
Bounds for resistivity and phase were
estimated at all data frequencies and plotted without the fancy
option. The single excluded phase remains an outlier, but there
is clearly no reason to exclude the resistivity at the same period.
.PP
You should try the following exercises: Bound all $rho sub a$
using only the $rho sub a$ data and then estimate the high frequency
gain and bounds to all $rho sub a$ and $phi$ using options -2.
The first exercise should lead you to conclude that the
resistivity at 4.5 Hz is an outlier with respect to the $rho sub a$
data prior to any gain correction and that the $rho sub a$ with
no gain modification are
compatible with B-polarization (TM). However, this
requires accepting that the phase data are either incompatible
with the resistivities or have very significantly underestimated
error bars at frequencies above 1.5 Hz.
The second exercise (option -2) results in almost exactly same gain
as before if the resistivity at 4.5 Hz is
included and 1.2185 if it is excluded. However, the bounds when
$rho sub a$ at 4.5 Hz is excluded do not support its exclusion.
Recomputing the bounds with the gain of 1.2185 and phase
included (option -3) leads to a credible scenario in which both
$rho sub a$ and $phi$ at 4.5 Hz can be excluded. $chi sup 2$ is somewhat
higher than for Figure 3 (17.26 versus 10.55) but still acceptable.
This illustrates the difficulty of estimating gain with resistivity
alone. Because phase is less prone to bias than is
resistivity, we favor using both resistivity and phase unless there
is a strong argument against it.

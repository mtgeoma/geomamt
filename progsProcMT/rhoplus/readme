rhoplus.f     Fortran program to invert MT data (self-contained)

              After compiling this program, running it with no
                arguments or re-directed input enters interactive mode.
              Entering "?" displays on-line documentation.

              It is our intention to make this code as portable as possible.

              This program has been compiled in the following environments:
                Solaris 1 (BSD 4.1) on Sparc
                Solaris 2 on Sparc
                WATCOM fortran on Pentium PC
                Convex

              If you successfully compile in a different environment
                and the test cases run properly, please send a message
                to:

                     booker@geophys.washington.edu

              If you have have to modify anything to compile or run
                successfully, please also send a message. We will
                incorporate changes that do not lead to problems with
                other compilers.

****************************************************************************
              ALWAYS IDENTIFY THE RELEASE DATE in any message!
              The date is in the fifth line of the code. It will be
                in the first line of screen output and appears in
                the first line of the general output and debug files.

SUB-DIRECTORIES

tests:          directory with test cases

  in/name.dat   Input files for tests discussed in documentation.
                These files are to be re-directed to standard input of the
                  compiled program -OR- can be run using the command
                  "read name.dat" if you are running interactively
                  in the directory containing the file name.dat.
                  If you are running in another directory, you will need
                  to specify the path to the .dat file relative to the
                  directory you are in when you start the program.

  out/files     Output files for tests in documentation

docs:         directory with following files

  rhoplus.doc   Documentation text file that can be typeset with troff.
                It has both equations and tables and uses ms macros.
                This file can be read in any text editor if you cannot
                  read postscript or use troff. The meanings of the
                  equations and tables is obvious.

Following can be sent to a postscript printer or viewed with ghostscript

  doc.ps        postscript file of documentation

  fig1.ps       postscript file to accompany doc.ps
  fig2.ps       postscript file to accompany doc.ps
  fig3.ps       postscript file to accompany doc.ps

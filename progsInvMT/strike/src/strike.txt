Strike: v4.0 documentation
Build date: 17-Sept-2004

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Documentation version: v1.4
Date: 17 September 2004

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Strike performs Groom-Bailey type tensor decomposition on magnetotelluric data 
from one or more sites in a specified band of frequency. The user may give a 
wide band for study, then spcify a smaller bandwidth within that wide band with 
or without an overlap.

The MT data are to be in J-format or in EDI-format, with one file per station.
The code will read in a single site of data (required extensions are ".dat" or ".edi"), 
or a list of data files that can be a mix of J-format and EDI-format files.

The user can specify an impedance relative error floor. If errors read in
are less than this floor, then the errors are set to that floor. The
floor is set on impedance, so is consistent between resistivity and
phase. If the floor is set to zero, then the errors in the data files are
used. NOTE: Comparison between parametric error estimates using Stodt's
algorithms (the basis of Geotools errors and most contractors) and jackknife
error estimates demonstrated that the parameteric errors are too small, by
factors of up to ten, when the numbers of estimates is large (Chave and Jones, 1997). 
This typically occurs in the MT "dead-band", of 10 Hz - 10 s, and
may explain the often poor fits one sees in the literature at these
frequencies when decomposition procedures are applied.

The user can specify whether realizations should be generated or not, and
how many. This is for determining statistical bounds on the decomposition
parameters. A bootstrap approach is used whereby new impedance realization 
estimates are generated using a random number generator and the variances of 
the impedance estimates. The variances on the decomposition estimates are
derived either using a parametric approach (if the number of realizations
is less than a specified number) or a jackknife approach. If the number of
realizations is too low, then the extremal values are listed.

The output files contain the decomposition parameters and their standard 
errors (or extremal values). This file can be converted to a J-format file
using the supplied code "dcmp2j.f".

NAG routines

The current version of strike uses NAG F77 routines. You have to provide
these yourself. Information is available on web site www.nag.com.

The main minimization routine in v3.1 of strike is E04UPF (html file included 
in distribution). This routine is available up to and including Version 18 of 
the F77 NAG library. In version 19 it was replaced by E04UNF (PDF file 
included in distribution). If you buy ver 19 or higher I can provide you with 
ver 16a routines for comparison testing. (You will need to provide proof of 
ownership of a NAG licence before I can send you the ver 16 routines.)

QUESTIONS:


>>>>Expert mode (y/n)  [default: N ] >

Unless your name is either Gary McNeice or Alan Jones, you should answer
NO to this question. Answering YES will allow you to request estimates
to be written out from the realizations, give to control over certain
NAG minimization parameters, allow you to specify the starting
solution and the starting seed integer. Unless you know NAG routines well, 
we advise you to leave well alone. The other parameters may be useful.


>>>>Site list (.dat for single site)?  [default: site.lis ] >

Specify here either the name of a single data file (must end in ".dat"),
or the name of a file which lists the data files you want to use. The data
are to be in J-format.


>>>>Give impedance relative error floor (in %)  [default: 1.7500 ] >

Specify impedance relative error floor. A value of 1.75% in impedance is
equivalent to 1 deg in phase and 3.52% in apparent resistivity.


>>>>>Give normalization type (? for list)  [default: GAVSD2 ] >

***NEW to v3.1***
Sets the denominator in the minimization scheme.
 L2          L2 unweighted normalization
 MAXSD       maximum s.d. weighted normalization
 GAVSD       geom. av. s.d. weighted normalization
 GAVSD2      geom. av. s.d. (Zxx,Zyy) & (Zxy,Zyx) weighted normalization
 SUMSQ       sqrt(sum squares s.d.) weighted normalization
 SUMSQ2      sqrt(sum squares s.d. (Zxx,Zyy) & (Zxy,Zyx)) weighted normalization

It is useful to try different normalizations to see how robust the strike
angle determined is. If it varies greatly with different schemes, then the
data probably have different strikes over the frequency/site ranges chosen.
The default seems to give the most consistent results.


>>>>Enter minimum period?  [default: 0.10000E-03 ] >

Specify the minimum period to study


>>>>Enter maximum period?  [default: 10000. ] >

Specify the maximum period to study


>>>>Enter bandwidth (no. of period decades)?  [default: 2.0000 ] >

Specify the bandwidth of the bands that you wish to study. The default is
the whole bandwidth between the minimum and maximum periods specified. If
you give a value any less than this, then you will be working with multiple
bands, each of which will derive independent decomposition parameters. This
is a good way of studying depth-dependent strike variation.


>>>>Enter overlap   (no. of period decades)?  [default: 0.0 ] >

Specify the overlap between bands. The default is for no overlap.


>>>>Place bounds on parameters (T or F) ?  [default: Y ] >

Specify whether you wish to bound the decomposition parameters or not.


>>>Change bounds from standard bounds (y/n)?  [default: N ] >

The standard bounds are

  Regional azimuth bounds    -360.000     360.000
             Shear bounds    -45.0000     45.0000
             Twist bounds    -60.0000     60.0000

You can specify whether you wish to change these bounds if you wish a
constrained fit.
NOTE: Often the minimization routine will hit a bound. Once there because the
default start for minimization is WARM (i.e., use the last parameters found 
as the new starting solution) then it will stay at the bound.


>>>>Do statistics (y/n)  [default: N ] >

Specify whether you wish multiple-realizations to be generated so that the
bounds on the parameters will be determined using either a parametric approach
(for number of realizations less than a given minimum number) or a 
jackknife approach to the bootstrap-generated estimates.


If you say YES, then you will be asked:
>>>>Give number of realizations (default is maximum permitted)  [default: 21 ] >

Specify the number of realizations to generate.

size.inc

The user can modify the dimension sizing to be appropriate for the
problem by editing size.inc. The parameters should be set as small as possible,
as the requrements of NAG workspace go as the square of the number of data.
There are six parameters that are user-definable, and are:

MAXS        maximum number of sites
MAXF        maximum number of frequencies per band
MAXDAT      maximum number of data frequencies in file
MAXBND      maximum number of bands
NREL        maximum number of realizations
MINREL      minimum number of realizations for jackknife statistics

None of the other parameters should be modified.

The executable becomes really large for large problems. I think I have the
parameters set properly for the NAG routine, but I may have something set
incorrectly. If you note an error in the size.inc file, please let me know.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OUTPUT:

The output files are one for each station with the name the same as the
input file and the extension ".dcmp" (".dcm" on DOS). This file contains
the decomposition parameters and their ranges. The parameters are listed
in the order:

   14 regional azimuth
   14 shear angle
   14 channelling angle
   14 twist angle
   14 app rho a
   14 app rho b
   14 imped phase a
   14 imped phase b
   14 error 
   14 skew 
   14 anis 


where the integer ("14" in this case) is the number of periods.

Various codes exist for plotting and reformatting these .dcmp files.

Also, the output files can be converted to J-format using "dcmp2j". Once
in J-format, they can be converted to EDI using "j2edi" available from
MTNet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXAMPLE:

An example data file is supplied, strike_example.dat. It contains 25 estimates
in the range 4 - 13653 s. The run is also supplied, (strike_example.run) as
is the main output file (strike_example.dcmp).

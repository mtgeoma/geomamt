C  Comments:
C  =========
C  Runge-Kutta formula pairs are described by a set of coefficients
C  and by the setting of a number of parameters that describe the
C  characteristics of the pair.  The input variable METHD indicates
C  which of the three pairs available is to be set. In the case of
C  METHD = 2 additional coefficients are defined that make interpolation
C  of the results possible and provide an additional error estimator.
C  VECSTG is the number of columns of workspace required to compute the
C  stages of a METHD. For interpolation purposes the routine returns via
C  COMMON the logical variable INTP indicating whether interpolation is
C  possible and via the call list:
C  REQSTG - whether the stages are required to form the
C           interpolant (set .FALSE. if INTP=.FALSE.)
C  LINTPL - the number of extra columns of storage required for use
C           with D02PCF (set 0 if INTP=.FALSE.)
C
C  Quantities set in common blocks:
C  METHD - copy of METHOD
C  A, B, C, BHAT - coefficients of the selected method
C  R      - extra coefficents for interpolation with METHD = 2
C  E      - extra coefficients for additional local error estimate
C           with METHD = 2
C  PTR    - vector of pointers indicating how individual stages are to
C           be stored.  With it zero coefficients of the formulas can
C           be exploited to reduce the storage required
C  NSTAGE - number of stages for the specified METHD
C  INTP   - indicates whether there is an associated interpolant
C           (depending on the method, the user may have to supply
C           extra workspace)
C  MINTP  - the degree of the interpolating polynomial, if one exists
C  FSAL   - indicates whether the last stage of a step can be used as
C           the first stage of the following step
C  LSTSTG - pointer to location of last stage for use with FSAL=.TRUE.
C  ORDER  - the lower order of the pair of Runge-Kutta formulas that
C           constitute a METHD
C  TANANG,
C  STBRAD - the stability region of the formula used to advance
C           the integration is approximated by a sector in the left half
C           complex plane.  TANANG is the tangent of the interior angle
C           of the sector and STBRAD is the radius of the sector.
C  COST   - cost of a successful step in function evaluations
C  MAXTRY - limit on the number of iterations in the stiffness check. As
C           set, no more than 24 function evaluations are made in the
C           check.
C  NSEC   - each step of size H in the primary integration corresponds
C           to NSEC steps of size H/NSEC in the secondary integration
C           when global error assessment is done.
C  EXPON  - used to adjust the step size; this code implements an error
C           per step control for which EXPON = 1/(ORDER + 1).
C  SAFETY - quantity used in selecting the step size
C  TOOSML - quantity used to determine when a step size is too small for
C           the precision available
C  RS, RS1,
C  RS2, RS3,
C  RS4    - quantities used in determining the maximum and minimum
C           change in step size (set independently of METHD)
C
C  Further comments on SAFETY:
C ============================
C  The code estimates the largest step size that will yield the
C  specified accuracy.  About half the time this step size would result
C  in a local error that is a little too large, and the step would be
C  rejected.  For this reason a SAFETY factor is used to reduce the
C  "optimal" value to one more likely to succeed. Unfortunately, there
C  is some art in choosing this value. The more expensive a failed step,
C  the smaller one is inclined to take this factor. However, a small
C  factor means that if the prediction were good, more accuracy than
C  desired would be obtained and the behavior of the error would then
C  be irregular.  The more stringent the tolerance, the better the
C  prediction, except near limiting precision. Thus the general range
C  of tolerances expected influences the choice of SAFETY.

C    This pair is from "An Efficient Runge-Kutta (4,5) Pair" by
C    P. Bogacki and L.F. Shampine, Rept. 89-20, Math. Dept.,
C    Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas, USA, 1989.
C    The authors are grateful to P. Bogacki for his assistance in
C    implementing the pair.  Shampine and Bogacki subsequently
C    modified the formula to enhance the reliability of the pair.
C    The original fourth order formula is used in an estimate of
C    the local error.  If the step fails, the computation is broken off.
C    If the step is acceptable, the first evaluation of the next step is
C    done, i.e., the pair is implemented as FSAL and the local error of
C    the step is again estimated with a fourth order formula using the
C    additional data. The step must succeed with both estimators to be
C    accepted.  When the second estimate is formed, it is used for the
C    subsequent adjustment of the step size because it is of higher
C    quality.  The two fourth order formulas are well matched to leading
C    order, and only exceptionally do the estimators disagree --
C    problems with discontinuous coefficients are handled more reliably
C    by using two estimators as is global error estimation.
